## Speedrun Stuff

My current small project playing with the public [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) [API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api): [https://github.com/retroph/speedrun-watch]

[Bugs / Issue tracker](https://github.com/retroph/speedrun-watch/issues) - don't hesitate to report problems you see in posted runs, either there or directly on Twitter.

### Discord Bots

- Sega Master System new submitted runs on the [MasterSystem.racing](http://mastersystem.racing/) Discord
- Many retro platforms on my [personal Discord server](https://discord.gg/nrB5Fss)

Just message me if you want a runs feed added to your discord channel!

### Twitter Bots

I run several Twitter accounts posting new verified runs for several retro platforms.
More coming soon.

Note: some runs for alternative platforms like VC are still missing, will be added soon.
